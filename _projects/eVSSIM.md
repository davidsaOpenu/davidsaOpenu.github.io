Diving into Flash device issues usually means delving deep into crafting, testing, and assessing new-fangled algorithms and methods tailored for these devices. Picture poring over Flash device specs, crafting device drivers (or dissecting an existing one), tweaking both the device driver and OS to seamlessly integrate your freshly minted algorithms, and finally, conducting a meticulous performance evaluation using enterprise workloads. This whole process demands not just mad skills in OS and device-driver development but also an encyclopedic grasp of Flash device specifications.

Now, here's the kicker â€” doing all this on an actual Flash device is no walk in the park. It's a hefty task that involves a multitude of steps: designing, implementing, testing, and evaluating. An alternative, a more laid-back one, you might say, is the world of modeling and simulation. Simulators not only turbocharge the design and development hustle but also spill the tea on insights that help you make decisions. These decisions can later be tried and tested in real-life environments. 

HW/SW requirements: 4-64 GB RAM, 150 GB partition on HW, Linux (on a baremetal machine)

Language: C (high), C++ (basic), Python (basic), Ansible (basic)
