Hey there! I've been on a wild teaching ride rocking Operating Systems courses at the Open University of Israel. Currently, I'm the captain of the [Workshop in Operating Systems](https://www-e.openu.ac.il/courses/20587.htm) ship. For the past chunk of time, I've been the brain behind cool didactic materials for the OS courses, making sure students not only get it but enjoy the journey. As the Teaching Coordinator for the Operating Systems Course, I played the friendly overseer of an awesome team of instructors. Let's just say, making education fun and effective has been my jam!
